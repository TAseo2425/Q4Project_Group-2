            <ul>
                     <li>Aseo - Next year, I believe that ICT will become more confusing. I also hope we get taught more stuff to make websites more personal and engaging.</li>
                <li>Calanglang - Next year, I do hope we get started with Python or start making our own HTTPS so we can make our own personal websites for the world to see. I do also hope we learn how to code in game instead of just for a website. </li>
                <li>Ko - Next year, I know that ICT will get harder and more frustrating. I do hope that there's still fun in it and I master it. </li>
                <li>Mendoza - Next year, all I know is ICT will get harder due to the different coding language. I hope that Python will be easier to understand at the very least. </li>
                <li>Pontillas - Next year, I expect ICT to become more difficult and challenging. I also hope that the other elements of coding and programming are also taught next year. </li>
